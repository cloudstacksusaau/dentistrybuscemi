	<h1>Buscemi Family Dentistry</h1>
	<p>
	The mouth is home to many bacteria that can lead to tooth decay or gum disease. Even though we brush our teeth twice a day, the bacteria in plaque continue to build up and cause problems. The best way for us to maintain healthy teeth is by visiting our dentist regularly. Buscemi Family Dentistry can help you with teeth cleaning and dental checkups.

	We offer a wide variety of biomimetic services, including teeth whitening or inlays and onlays instead of general fillings for those that are experiencing tooth decay. We also provide sealants to help prevent cavities in children as well as fluoride treatments which can be important for older adults who don’t drink enough water.

	Patients today want more than just the standard “teeth cleaning” at our office. They expect their dentists to be able to do everything from simple extractions without an oral surgeon to cosmetic restorations such as porcelain crowns or veneers because they know anything less will result in discomfort and poorer quality of life down the road.

	Buscemi Family Dentistry provides the biomimetic dental care you deserve! They want their patients to be happy with what they have accomplished by providing them with quality workmanship and excellent customer service that satisfies every need.
